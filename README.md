This project is a game where a player can use their location to travel around a map and collect digital geocache coins.  The game uses a board that generates tiles for the player to visiably see what geocaches are in their area in a given radius.   Players can collect a coin from these geo caches with a unique serial number to be added to their collection or traded away at different geocaches to make the coin travel.
